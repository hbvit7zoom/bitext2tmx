    <h2>Available Documentation</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="QuickStart.html">Quick Start</a>
      <br />
       - a short tutorial to get started quickly with bitext2tmx</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      bitext2tmx(<img align="bottom" src="b2t-icon20x16.png" alt="bitext2tmx Logo" border="0" />) is a free Computer Aided/Assisted Translation (CAT) related
      tool to create translation memories in TMX format from bitext of an
      original and translation of the same textual content. The corresponding
      generated TMX document can be used in other CAT tools that can leverage
      the aligned segments for matching and reuse purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      To start working with <img align="bottom" src="b2t-icon20x16.png" alt="bitext2tmx Logo" border="0" /> a user opens two documents in the program. One
      document is the original version of a text and the other is its corresponding
      translation. Both documents must be in the same format (plain-text currently),
      but their file encodings may differ (select encoding when opening documents).
      Upon opening of the two documents, <img align="bottom" src="b2t-icon20x16.png" alt="bitext2tmx Logo" border="0" /> will attempt to align them into related
      segments as best it can. It does this by using various rules, but it does
      not guarantee that the alignments will be anywhere near perfect. <img align="bottom" src="b2t-icon20x16.png" alt="bitext2tmx Logo" border="0" /> aids
      the user in creating a correct alignment of parallel texts, it cannot in most
      cases do this by itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is also possible to use <img align="bottom" src="b2t-icon20x16.png" alt="bitext2tmx Logo" border="0" /> to edit TMX documents. In this way TMX
      documents can be aligned to provide better matches, but more importantly
      for <img align="bottom" src="b2t-icon20x16.png" alt="bitext2tmx Logo" border="0" /> users it means they can save there work out to TMX and read it
      back in to continue editing at a later time without loss of work or data.
    </p>




    <h2>Window</h2>

    <p>
      The <img align="bottom" src="b2t-icon20x16.png" alt="bitext2tmx Logo" border="0" /> main window contains a number of embedded windows (editors, views).
      It has a docking desktop type interface that allows the contained parts
      to be manipulated to a certain degree so that the user can customize the
      interface to their own viewing preferences. In the default setup the
      following are visible:
    </p>

    <h3>Bitext Alignments/Segments Table (Alignments)</h3>

    <p>
      The <em>Alignments</em> view contains a table of the original and translation
      segments. Segments in this view can be selected, with the corresponding text
      shown in its associated segment editor for editing.
    </p>

    <h3>Original Segment Editor (Original)</h3>

    <p>Editor for the original segment.</p>

    <h3>Translation Segment Editor (Translation)</h3>

    <p>Editor for the translation segment.</p>

    <h3>Alignment/Segment Controls (Controls)</h3>

    <p>
      This view contains buttons for editing the alignments/segments. The lower
      left and right side buttons operate on the original and translation segments,
      respectively. They apply to their particular column of the alignments table.
      The center buttons work more generally.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Join</em>: adds together a table cell's contents with the contents of
        the following cell of the same column;
      </li>
      <li><em>Delete</em>: removes a table cell and its contents;</li>
      <li>
        <em>Split</em>: divides a table cell at the current location of the cursor.
        Cursor location is set in the associated segment editor. If no location is
        manually set then the whole cell is split, because the cursor is by default
        located at the beginning of the text in the cell. This can be used to insert
        blank cells in a column, if desired;
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Delete Blank Rows</em>: removes all blank rows selected in the table;
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Split TU</em>: separates the current aligned original and translation
        segments into two units that are aligned to blank segments. A blank cell
        is entered after the original segment and before the translation segment.
        Thereby resulting in the translation segment being pushed down one row in
        the table.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Segmentation</h2>

    <p>
      <img align="bottom" src="b2t-icon20x16.png" alt="bitext2tmx Logo" border="0" /> segments text of the opened documents according to a series of internal
      rules before display in the alignments table. In general, these rules cannot be
      altered. The only possible way to alter the behavior is by line breaks.
      Segmentation can be forced to occur on line breaks by choosing <em>Split by Line
      Break</em> from the <em>Settings</em> menu.
    </p>

    <h2>TMX Generation</h2>

    <p>
      With the option <i>Save</i> the TMX is generated (in version 1.1).
      You may want to use the resulting TMX as input for a particular
      translation memory capable tool; be sure that the language of the
      source text selected in Bitext2tmx is the same as the one of the
      language of the source text selected in the application. So, in the
      head of the TMX generated by Bitext2tmx, must appear in <i>srclang</i>
      the code of the source language, and it must be the same as the source
      language selected when a project is created.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Warning:</strong> closing the documents before saving will
      result in loss of all alignment changes (to be fixed in a future version).
    </p>

    <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

    <p>
      Original development on bitext2tmx was done by Susana Santos, with help from
      Sergio Ortiz-Rojas and Mikel L. Forcada (members of the the Transducens research
      group at the Departament de Llenguatges i Sistemes Informics, Universitat
      d'Alacant, Spain).
    </p>

    <p>
      The program originated inside the project "Finite-state translators based on
      bitexts harvested from the net" (2004–2006), that was funded by the now defunct
      Ministry of Science and Technology of Spain through grant number TIC2003-08681-C02.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ongoing development by Raymond Martin (OmegaT+ project) and Miquel Esplà.
      Contributions have also been made by Sabine Cretella, Valerie Martineau and others
      from the free software/open source community.
